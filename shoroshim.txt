Matityahu Clark makes the following interesting comment in his work
Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew: "There are no roots that begin with
the Hebrew consonant VAV (‫)ו‬. Words whose basic form does begin with a VAV
are usually part of the ‫ פה"פ( פ"י‬is YOD) family of roots". That aside, we are
presenting several possible ‫ ו‬roots.
